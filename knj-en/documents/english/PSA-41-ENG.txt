Blessed is he who has regard for the weak; the Lord delivers him in times of trouble.
The Lord will protect him and preserve his life; he will bless him in the land and not surrender him to the desire of his foes.
The Lord will sustain him on his sickbed and restore him from his bed of illness.
I said, “O Lord, have mercy on me; heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
My enemies say of me in malice, “When will he die and his name perish?”
Whenever one comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it abroad.
All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying,
“A vile disease has beset him; he will never get up from the place where he lies.”
Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
But you, O Lord, have mercy on me; raise me up, that I may repay them.
I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.
In my integrity you uphold me and set me in your presence forever.
Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
