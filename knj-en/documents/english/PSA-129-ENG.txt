They have greatly oppressed me from my youth– let Israel say–
they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.
Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.
But the Lord is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.
May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.
May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow;
with it the reaper cannot fill his hands, nor the one who gathers fill his arms.
May those who pass by not say, “The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.”
