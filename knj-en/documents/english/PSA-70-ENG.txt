Hasten, O God, to save me; O Lord, come quickly to help me.
May those who seek my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” turn back because of their shame.
But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, “Let God be exalted!”
Yet I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay.
