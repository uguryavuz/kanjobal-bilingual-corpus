THE RABBIT AND THE WATERMELON
There was a woman who was a friend of the priest's.
Every day she would go take him a watermelon and the priest would be very pleased. But the rabbit was the woman's enemy.
He was eating the watermelons and leaving his excrement in them.
One day at dawn the woman went to her watermelon patch.
And since she didn't know what was inside the watermelons, she went to give one to the priest.
He took it from her and the woman went home.
Later when the priest felt like having some of the watermelon he split it open and saw the rabbit excrement inside.
He was angry with the woman, and sent for her.
"Why have you deceived me?" asked the priest.
"What?" asked the woman.
He showed her the problem:
Look what you brought me.
"There's rabbit excrement in your watermelon," the priest said to the woman.
"Oh, my goodness! The rabbit deceived me!" said the woman.
