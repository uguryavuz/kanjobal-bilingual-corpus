The Lord says to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion; you will rule in the midst of your enemies.
Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy majesty, from the womb of the dawn you will receive the dew of your youth.
The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”
The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.
He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.
He will drink from a brook beside the way; therefore he will lift up his head.
