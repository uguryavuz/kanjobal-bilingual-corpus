O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.
They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.
They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.
We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.
How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;
for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland.
Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.
Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.
May the groans of the prisoners come before you; by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die.
Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord.
Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
