PEDRO RIMARES AND THE MERCHANT
Pedro Rimares was sitting in the shade of a trec when a merchant came by.
"What are you doing?" asked the merchant.
"I’m taking care of my tree here."
"Why?" asked the merchant.
"Stay here with me and you’ll see," Pedro told the merchant.
He sat down near Pedro.
The merchant noticed that some coins fell down from the tree.
"Sell me your tree," said the merchant.
"I don’t want to sell it," said Pedro Rimares, "because this tree is my sustenance," said Pedro.
“If you sell it to me," said the merchant.
"I’ll give you all my merchandise as the price of the tree," said the merchant.
"All right," said Pedro, "wait for the money to fall down from the tree."
"All right," said the merchant, and sat down to wait. He waited along time but there was no money.
Why did Pedro deceive me?
"I'm going to go up into the branches of the tree," said the merchant.
He climbed up into the tree and realized that what he had believed was not true.
When he shook the branches of the tree he saw that there wasn’t any money.
The tree had no fruit, there was just a beehive there on the tree to which Pedro Rimares had stuck a few coins.
The merchant cried and came down from the tree.
He was sad.
