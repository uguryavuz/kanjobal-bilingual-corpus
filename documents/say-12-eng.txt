PEDRO RIMARES AND THE FLYING HORSE
Once Pedro Rimares resuscitated a dead horse of which only the skin remained.
Buzzards had entered into the skin and he sewed it up. He prayed over it and was able to revive the dead horse.
The buzzards stayed inside the skin of the dead horse and flew into the air, as if it were an airplane.
He met a merchant with a lot of money and merchandise.
The merchant took a liking to the horse.
Your horse is very nice, Pedro.
"Why don’t you sell it tome?" the merchant asked Pedro.
Do you think you can afford to buy my horse? It’s too expensive for you.
But if you want to give me all your money, all your cloth, and all your merchandise, I'll give you the horse.
"But how do you get it to fly through the air?" asked the merchant.
"I'll show you how to do it," he replied. 
"What you do is give him a kick in the belly and then you pull his tail over your shoulder," Rimares told the merchant.
"All right, said the merchant.”
So Pedro went with the money and the load of merchandise.
The merchant was real happy.
“Now I have my airplane and I’m going to fly in the sky," said the merchant.
So he went flying real high in the air. It occurred to him: 
"My horse has flown a lot. I’m going to try to do as Pedro told me. I'm going to pull the tail so that it will go faster," thought the merchant.
So the merchant pulled the horse’s tail hard and he fell down from the sky and was killed.
The poor merchant died with his airplane.
The buzzards came out flying and that was the end of the horse.
It fell from the sky. The merchant fell from the sky to the earth.
And so ends another funny story of Pedro Rimares.
