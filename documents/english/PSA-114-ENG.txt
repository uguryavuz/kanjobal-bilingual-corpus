When Israel came out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,
Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back;
the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,
you mountains, that you skipped like rams, you hills, like lambs?
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.
