Not to us, O Lord, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.
Why do the nations say, “Where is their God?”
Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him.
But their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.
They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see;
they have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but they cannot smell;
they have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but they cannot walk; nor can they utter a sound with their throats.
Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.
O house of Israel, trust in the Lord– he is their help and shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord– he is their help and shield.
You who fear him, trust in the Lord– he is their help and shield.
The Lord remembers us and will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron,
he will bless those who fear the Lord– small and great alike.
May the Lord make you increase, both you and your children.
May you be blessed by the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
The highest heavens belong to the Lord, but the earth he has given to man.
It is not the dead who praise the Lord, those who go down to silence;
it is we who extol the Lord, both now and forevermore. Praise the Lord.
