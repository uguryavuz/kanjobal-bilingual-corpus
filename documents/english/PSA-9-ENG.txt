I will praise you, O Lord, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonders.
I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.
For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging righteously.
You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.
The Lord reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with justice.
The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you.
Sing praises to the Lord, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.
For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.
O Lord, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
that I may declare your praises in the gates of the Daughter of Zion and there rejoice in your salvation.
The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
The Lord is known by his justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah
The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.
But the needy will not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the afflicted ever perish.
Arise, O Lord, let not man triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.
Strike them with terror, O Lord; let the nations know they are but men. Selah
