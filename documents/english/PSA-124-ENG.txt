If the Lord had not been on our side– let Israel say–
if the Lord had not been on our side when men attacked us,
when their anger flared against us, they would have swallowed us alive;
the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, the raging waters would have swept us away.
Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be torn by their teeth.
We have escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
