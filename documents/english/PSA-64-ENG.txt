Hear me, O God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.
Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from that noisy crowd of evildoers.
They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.
They shoot from ambush at the innocent man; they shoot at him suddenly, without fear.
They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, “Who will see them?”
They plot injustice and say, “We have devised a perfect plan!” Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning.
But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be struck down.
He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
All mankind will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.
Let the righteous rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; let all the upright in heart praise him!
