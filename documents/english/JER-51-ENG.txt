This is the message Jeremiah gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign.
Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon–all that had been recorded concerning Babylon.
He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud.
Then say, ‘O Lord, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither man nor animal will live in it; it will be desolate forever.’
When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates.
Then say, ‘So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring upon her. And her people will fall.’ ” The words of Jeremiah end here.
