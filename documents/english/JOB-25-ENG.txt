Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
“Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?
How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,
how much less man, who is but a maggot– a son of man, who is only a worm!”
