THE CRAB AND THE TOAD
"Where are you going to sell those boards, uncle crab?" the toad asked.
I'm going to sell them in town, in a city with a big mouth.
Do you know where that city with the big mouth is?
No, I don't know. Could it be me you are referring to?
Why do you say I am referring to you?
Because you're asking me where I'm going to sell my boards.
Well, it's in a city with a very large mouth, uncle toad.
"Why does that city have a large mouth?" asked the toad.
That city has a large mouth, so my boards will fit right in its mouth.
Oh! You're telling me that because I have a large mouth, uncle.
I beg your pardon.
You beat me because I thought you weren't going to be able to defend yourself.
Well, I do have a large mouth and I was just talking to you about wooden boards.
Do you actually sell boards with all those extremities you have?
So now I say let's forgive each other.
You forgive me and I'll forgive you.
You've won.
I wasn't really saying that you were carrying boards; I was just telling you that on account of the limbs on your forehead, that's why I was talking about boards.
So now let's stop talking about this.
"Never more will we say we are friends," said the toad jesting. "No, you know we are still friends."
Why did you say I am was a wood merchant?
I was just joking with you.
Don't worry, now we'll be brothers, and we'll live in I peace.
