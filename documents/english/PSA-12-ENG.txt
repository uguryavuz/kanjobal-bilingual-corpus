Help, Lord, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.
Everyone lies to his neighbor; their flattering lips speak with deception.
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue
that says, “We will triumph with our tongues; we own our lips– who is our master?”
“Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says the Lord. “I will protect them from those who malign them.”
And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven times.
O Lord, you will keep us safe and protect us from such people forever.
The wicked freely strut about when what is vile is honored among men.
