“In that day,” declares the Lord, “I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots.

I will destroy your carved images and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.
I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles and demolish your cities.
I will take vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations that have not obeyed me.”
