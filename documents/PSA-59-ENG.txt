Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise up against me.
Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men.
See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, O Lord.
I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!
O Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors. Selah
They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.
See what they spew from their mouths– they spew out swords from their lips, and they say, “Who can hear us?”
But you, O Lord, laugh at them; you scoff at all those nations.
O my Strength, I watch for you; you, O God, are my fortress,
my loving God. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
But do not kill them, O Lord our shield, or my people will forget. In your might make them wander about, and bring them down.
For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,
consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city. They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.
But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
O my Strength, I sing praise to you; you, O God, are my fortress, my loving God.
